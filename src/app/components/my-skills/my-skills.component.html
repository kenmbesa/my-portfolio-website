    <h1>What am Good At</h1>
    <p>
      Before deciding to learn how to code, I was a WordPress expert, graphic
      designer and UI/UX designer. I still am, but I mainly use those skills to
      design my own stuff. In 2021, a few weeks after deciding to learn how to
      code, I realized that the best and quickest way to learn the principles of
      programming was to work on real-world projects. So I set out to learn not
      buy watching tutorials and copying the tutors' code, but by understanding
      why they are doing things the way they are doing them, and then applying
      that to my own small projects. This led me to quickly learn how to create
      beautiful responsive websites and medium sized web apps with HTML, CSS and
      vanilla JavaScript. The websites and web apps that I build are fast, easy
      to use, and built with best practices in mind. Today, I am proud to be a
      full-stack developer who mainly builds applications with Mongo, ExpressJS,
      Angular and NodeJS (The MEAN stack).
